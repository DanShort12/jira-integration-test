This repo demonstrates some test functionality in Jira/GitHub.

## Linking Commits

Link a commit to an issue by referencing that issue in the commit message.

e.g. [JIT-1] A commit.

## Linking PRs and branches

A PR can be linked by referencing the issue in the PR name or in the source branch.

If you're in a branch with a JIRA reference then you don't need to link individual commits.
